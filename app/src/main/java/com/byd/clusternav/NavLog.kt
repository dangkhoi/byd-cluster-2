/**
 * Cheap IN-MEMORY gate for verbose diagnostic logging.
 *
 * OTA ships a RELEASE apk (no `BuildConfig.DEBUG`) and the owner debugs on-car via logcat, so verbosity is a
 * RUNTIME flag defaulting OFF — flipped by the hidden long-press on the version label (MainActivity) and mirrored
 * here so per-frame hot paths (BydHal keep-alive, ClusterBroadcaster / NavArrowLog / NavDistanceLog,
 * ManeuverSignature.note) read a `@Volatile` field instead of hitting SharedPreferences ~4×/second.
 *
 * The persisted source of truth is [Prefs.navVerboseLog]; [init] refreshes this mirror at the app entry points
 * that always run (MainActivity.onCreate, NavNotificationListener.onListenerConnected) and the D5 toggle keeps
 * both in sync.
